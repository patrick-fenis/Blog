# Blog

This app is going to be a blog. Something along the lines of Tumblr or the like. To achieve MVP we will be building a backend using Node, Express and MongoDB. Using these tools we will create the functionality for a user on this app to be able to create blog posts, view them and edit or delete them from the server altogether. 

The front end will utilize react to allow us to display mutiple aspects of the blog on the same screen. We will show a feed of all the blog posts alongside a side screen that allows a closer look at the post as well as allowing the user to edit or delete said post. 

As stretch goals for this we would like to also develop a login page and allow the user to browse the website as an individual and have exclusive rights to edit and delete their own posts. We would also like to include a 3rd party API in order to display some outside data for the site to have some extra content.
